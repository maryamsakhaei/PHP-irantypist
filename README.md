A mini-project involves the arrangement of text or a book for either translation or typing purposes. This empowers users to select the text type and translator, as well as specify the desired timeline. Subsequently, users gain access to a record of their order history. Meanwhile, administrators can perform word counts and establish corresponding pricing structures. Following user confirmation of the proposed timeframe and price, the process proceeds to the payment phase. Once payment is completed and the admin gives final authorization, a unique tracking code is furnished to the user.
